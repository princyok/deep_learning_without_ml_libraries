# deep_learning_without_ml_libraries

A deep learning module for a standard feedforward neural network designed straight from the mathematical formulations and without reliance on any machine learning libraries.

Some ML libraries were used for preprocessing of data in the demonstrations, but none were used for the multilayer perceptron.
